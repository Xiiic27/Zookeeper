# Zookeeper
First learning project (JetBrains Academy)

This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. The outcome is a tool for monitoring animals and their status.

This project helps to understand some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as lists, and while loops.
